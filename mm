Hope you're doing well.

It's been a while since we last caught up. We still have some pending items to complete. I have a small window of availability next week. If we could find some time, I can take note of the requirements needed to finalize this report, as it has been pending for quite a while.

Could you please arrange a meeting with the team, or if you can address those points directly, I'd be happy to finish the report and get it signed off.

I appreciate your prompt response.

Thank you
